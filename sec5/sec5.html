			<h2>Hello.</h2>
			<p class="intro">SpongeBob is a childish and joyful sea sponge who lives in a pineapple with his pet snail Gary in
				the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. He works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, a job which he is exceptionally
				skilled at and enjoys thoroughly. He attends Mrs. Puff's Boating School, and his greatest dream in life is to
				receive his boating license. Unfortunately, he tenses up whenever he has to drive a boatmobile, and he drives
				recklessly. SpongeBob is very good-natured and loves to hang out with his best friend Patrick. His teacher is
				Mrs. Puff and his boss is Mr. Krabs.</p>

				<h3>Hunting Jellyfish</h3>
				<p class="skill-description1">SpongeBob is out jellyfishing in Jellyfish Fields. He catches a jellyfish, gently
					tickles out some of its jelly, and lets it go, naming it "Twelvy" on its way. He then spies a very rare blue
					jellyfish, the only jellyfish in the field he has never been able to catch and name, thus calling him "No
					Name." SpongeBob's attempt to catch this specimen ends in failure once again, despite having used himself like
					a rocket to get closer to it.</p>

				<h3>Taking a walk</h3>
				<p class="skill-description2">Gary was the only child of Sluggo Star and an unrevealed mother.

					At one point, he met SpongeBob at Camp Coral,[5] who then later adopted him at the local animal shelter when
					SpongeBob got older.[6][7] In "Treats!," a picture is shown of the moment SpongeBob picked him out, showing
					that Gary spent his early childhood at the pound with three other snails.
					One day, Gary betrayed SpongeBob in exchange for Patrick, though this was only done to retrieve a cookie from
					Patrick's pocket, and Gary subsequently returned to his original owner.[8]
